# Documentation Center
## Welcome to Documentation Center
Here you will find documentation for services used in our company. 
## How is Documentation Center different from the Storage?
Documentation Center complements the Storage and now serves as the primary location for documentation. The Storage remains the centralized storage for all other documents associated with services.
## Documentation versions
Documentation in the Documentation Center is versioned so you can view documents tailored to specific releases.
